## Hey there, I'm Jesus! ðŸ‘‹


### Bienvenu! ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=${jesusxambro}.${jesusxambro})

I'm a software engineer. I love solving problems, photography, and traveling. 

As a software engineer I enjoy learning the different approaches to tackle a problem and my desire to make a positive difference. 

### Some things about me:

* :technologist: I'm currently working on learning about React.
* :book: I'm finishing up a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
* :camera: I'm a photographer and street photography is my favorite. 
* :grey_question: Ask me a question! I love to share what I've learned.
